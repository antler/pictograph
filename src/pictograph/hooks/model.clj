;; a model hook recieves a map as its sole arg, that map contains keys that
;; are partially specific to its lifecycle position

;; generally, a hook should return a potentially modified version of the arg it
;; recieves

;; :content - the thing hooked
;; :model - the relevant model
;; :values - arguments to the function spawning hook - modify this to change
;;           what actually gets stored
;; :op - the operation spawning the hook (mainly used for the save hooks)
;; :opts - optional opts arg to model/create
;; :spec - for create hooks, describes how one would update this row
;; :original - for update hooks, the object before the operation in question
